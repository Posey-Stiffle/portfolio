<p>
My game is a rudimentary replica of a formerly popular mobile video game, Flappy Bird. The player controls the bird's upward movement by left clicking or tapping the screen and their goal is to not hit the pipes. If the player does collide with the pipes, the pipe will turn red and the "lives lost" counter will count up until it reaches 5. When all 5 lives are lost, a game over screen is displayed. The player can retry the game by clicking on the retry button, this will refresh the page. The pipe's movements gets faster over time to add a level of difficulty if the player keeps dodging the pipes. 
</p><p>
I used Chat GPT to help me in making this flappy bird-esque game. I do have some understanding of Java script, however it has been many years since I've used it and I have forgotten some functions that AI was able to help fill in the gaps for me. Overall, AI is a good aid in helping making this project and it would have taken me much longer without it.
