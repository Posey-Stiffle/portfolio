 For my triptych series I chose an image of matcha, boba tea, and Dubai chocolate. Asian food items like these have a long historical background and significant meaning in their own respective cultures, but they have been recently "trendified." I cannot speak for boba tea or Dubai chocolate since I am not from the cultures in which they came from, but I can speak about matcha as a half-Japanese person. In Japanese culture tea is important, and there are ceremonies conducted for tasting teas. Tea is cultivated and perfected by people whose life passion is to make the richest and highest-quality tea. This centuries-long history and deep cultural meaning for tea have recently been turned into a trend in the West. This has led to shortages of matcha and the mass disrespecting of the food. Intentionally glitching the images of these food items shows what the commodification of these items has done to them. They are now seen as a virtual status symbol and nothing more than that. They are no longer food items with historical and cultural significance. Making these items trendy has watered down their meanings within their own respective cultures.                         <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-purple-400">Technical Details</h3>
